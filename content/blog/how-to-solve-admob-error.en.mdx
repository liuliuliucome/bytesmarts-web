> Many people encounter various error problems when adding payment methods on admob, among which OR-BAAVFT-03 is an issue where the official does not provide a clear solution. You can refer to my experience to learn how to solve it.

## Why does this problem occur?

This problem is usually caused by changing the payment method, which triggers risk control. If the method is correct, it can be easily resolved.

## How to solve it?

Open first https://support.google.com/googlepay/gethelp Link.

Switch the language environment to English at the bottom, and then enter the question number.

Keep going and don't choose any other options midway.

Finally, the communication method can be selected as Chat (which requires English communication).

> If you have multiple payment information, please prepare the payment information ID in advance.

Then there is a form to inquire about your product. If it is an admob/adsense, please select other Google product
